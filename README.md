# Inches2SWG
This tool lets you convert inches to Standard Wire Gauge (SWG) or mm units.

How To Use:
  Open the website: https://anektimitis.github.io/Inches2SWG/
  Input your micrometer/screw gauge/wire gauge readings in the input box.
  In the next section will be your output of the matching SWG number and the same inches converted into mm.
  In the next section is a quick look up table ranging from 0 to 40 SWG.

Who is this useful for?
  People who wanna buy or sell wires!
  Standard Wire Gauge (SWG) system is used for standardized trading of wires, but its very goofy, usual micrometers can help you calculate the wire diameter in inches, input that diameter and get the matching SWG.

Note:
  About the two calculation modes, here is what happens:
    Best Fit 
      If inch value relates to something between two SWGs then if it is closer to thicker wire then it'll output the lower SWG, if exactly in between or far from thicker, then it'll result the thinner wire.
        This helps just in case if the thicker wire is too thick for customer's instrument and also just in case if you measure with insulation/partially removed insulation.
    Electrical Accuracy
      Results the closes SWG. Make sure you've removed the insulation completely and can tolerate thicker wires.
